### Notes

- if you want to connect to the db, it uses sqlite3

### How to run

1. Extract `cve.zip` in the same dir.
2. Update the `input.csv` file with the scanning results.
3. Do a `get_cves.py` dry run
   ```shell
   python get_cves.py -n
   ```
   and check `get_cves.log` for any vendor mappings that need to be added to `vendor_mapping.json`. Check the db for the actual vendor shortname (under `assignerShortName`).
4. You can now do a proper run of `get_cves`. For example, you can run 
   ```shell
   python get_cves.py --routers-only --severity 7.6 
   ```
   to get results for all CVEs related to routers, which have severity of at least 7.6. You can also run
   ```shell
   python get_cves.py --help
   ```
   to get a list of all the flags you can set.
