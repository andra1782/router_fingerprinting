### Notes

- if you want to connect to the db, it uses sqlite3
- you need uv to run the project (my bad)

### How to run

1. Extract `cve.zip` in the same dir
2. Create an `input.csv` file with these columns (taken from scanning results): 
    ```csv
    ip,enterprise,engineIDFormat,engineIDData,snmpEngineBoots,snmpEngineTime
    ```
3. Do a `get_cves.py` dry run (done by default), and check `get_cves.log` for any vendor mappings that need to be added to `vendor_mapping.json`. Check the db for the actual vendor shortname (under `assignerShortName`)
4. Set `DRY_RUN` to false, and do another run to get `found_cves.json`, which contains the CVEs found per ip address.
